[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) is running three
events a week.  The number could double by the end of 2015, but only
if we can [streamline setup and organization][blog-streamline].  The
goal of this project is to build a web-based workshop administration
application using Django.  It is not intended to be visible to the
general public, or even to instructors (at least initially â€” we may
add that later).  Instead, the target audience is administrators, most
of whon are non-programmers, who need to keep track of what workshops
are being arranged, when they're supposed to occur, who's teaching
what, and so on.
