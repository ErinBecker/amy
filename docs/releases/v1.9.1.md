# AMY bugfix release v1.9.1

AMY [v1.9.1][], intended to fix a major bug in `/forms/request_training/`,
incorporates a number of development-related changes that were scheduled for
[v1.10.0][].

## New development features

* [Chris][] Improved formatting in `ReportsViewSet`.
* [Aditya][] updated settings to work with local development (a change required
  by Django bugfix).
* [Aditya][] changed Travis-CI configuration to work correctly with PyData
  installation; especially he managed to set up a test matrix for checking code
  with PyData installed and without.
* [Aditya][] refactored views so that a prepopulation of forms would be easier
  to achieve for developers.

## Bugfixes

* [Piotr][] fixed a bug in training request form, which prevented users from
  seeing a confirmation of their request.
