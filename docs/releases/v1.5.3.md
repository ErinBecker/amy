# AMY release v1.5.3

A minor version [v1.5.3][] of AMY was released.

## New features

Now it's easier to add person to the database if they already submitted
a profile update request.

This is specifically useful for admins if they want to add one person and can
contact them to get more details (like affiliation or airport).

## Bug fixes

* [Aditya][] fixed Django template tags autoescaping on the revision
  page (ie. each page the changes log links to)
* [Aditya][] again fixed "Update from URL" functionality that didn't
  update event's URL in specific conditions.

Thanks a lot, Aditya!
