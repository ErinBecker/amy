# AMY release v1.5.1

This past month we had a number of submissions from prospect GSOC'16 students
(yay!) and, for the first time, number of bugs fixed exceeded number of new
enhancements.

Since the number of new features is small, we decided to release a minor version
([v1.5.1][]).


## Contributions by GSOC students

March 2016 held GSOC'16 applications period for students. We had a lot of
students this year and we encouraged them to take a look at AMY and maybe fix
something.  This resulted in a number of good contributions.


## New features

Starting with new features since there's so few of them:

* [Greg][] extended the `check_certificates.py` command to additionally
  return events people participated in
* [Shubham Singh][] added "Notes" field to instructor profile update form
* [Shubham Singh][] added new tag "hackaton"
* [Greg][] removed command `check_badges.py`
* [Piotr][] enabled autogeneration of user's username after they're added to the
  database
* [Greg][] added link to Privacy Policy in the footer.

  duplicates existed

  their textual representations

  was called "pre")
