# AMY release v1.2.0

This is the third post-gsoc release of AMY, the workshop management tool
for [Software-Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/). This release
was supported by [prof. Ethan White](http://whitelab.weecology.org/).
Thanks a lot!

Below you can find release notes for
[v1.2.0](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/milestones/v1.2).

## New features

-   (big one) fix finding, parsing and validating of event tags: it will
    now work with `<meta>` tags on workshop websites
-   after approving person's profile update request, the updated profile
    is displayed instead of the list of other update requests.
-   password reset form was added,
-   issues related to, for example, missing location data are now
    highlighted on event details page,
-   (big one) admins can now be assigned to specific events or event
    requests,
-   [Greg][] changed descriptions section names on "instructor issues" page,
-   the same page was updated by me so that we can have pending and
    "gave-up-on" trainees listed,
-   the previous feature was introduced thanks to new 'stalled' tag,
-   our API gained some filtering (go to
    <https://amy.software-carpentry.org/api/v1/events/published/>, click
    "OPTIONS" and look at "query\_params"; these can be added to the API
    calls, for example:
    <https://amy.software-carpentry.org/api/v1/events/published/?host=123456789&administrator=987654321>)
-   the same API gained a new endpoint used for generating list of
    current members of Software-Carpentry Foundation; this is in no way
    official list of members, but it can be used to help determine who's
    eligible (credits for this one go to both Greg and me since I
    finished his pull request),
-   it's now possible to search in events' URL, contact, venue and
    address fields,
-   2 new options for invoice status were added (*not invoiced for
    historical reasons* and *not invoiced because of membership*),
-   more places (workshop issues, and on each workshop without
    attendance data) to send "Give us attendance figures" emails, more
    people to send to,
-   profile update requests can now be edited by admins.

## Bug fixes

-   wrong object type passed to `"".format()` method
-   wrong characters permitted in event slugs
-   (big one) inconsistant logic in `EventQuerySet.(un)published_events`
    methods
