# AMY release v1.0.0

That was a looong ride, but we're finally here! AMY is mature enough to
be given the [v1.0.0](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/milestones/v1.0)
tag.


## New features

-   We have a new database for development use.
-   [Piotr][] changed the way AMY handles event URLs:
    -   admins cannot use GitHub repository URL for event's URL
    -   migration was used to change all URLs to website-URL format (if
        possible)
    -   [Piotr][] also fixed import/update from URL feature to auto-select
        country if possible
    -   â€¦and to auto-use correct website URL instead of repository URL.
-   AMY auto-counts event attendees if provided with a list of attendees
    (for example via bulk-upload).
-   External links now open in new tabs.
-   Now there are more options to `Event.invoice` (for example with reason
    for lack of invoice).
-   New remove awards functionality.


## Bug fixes

-   Bulk-uploaded CSVs with entries that contained empty rows (for
    example: `,,,,,,`) were treated as correct, but not anymore.
-   "Artificial" country European Union had been removed and was brought
    back since some hosts were using it.
-   API now returns website URLs to events instead of original URLs.
