# AMY release v1.7.0

After another two weeks of development and two weeks of delays, we're finally
releasing AMY [v1.7.0][]

This release is especially interesting since:

1. it includes mostly Aditya's and Chris' PRs
2. it includes two big PRs containing the biggest part of Aditya's and Chris'
   Summer projects.

## New features

* [Chris][] helped check for missing migrations in automated continuous
  integration service [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
* [Chris][] sped up Travis-CI checks of AMY's test suite by using
  a cache directory
* [Aditya][] as part of his
  [Summer work](https://blog.narayanaditya.in/) added titles and URLs to task
  objects in AMY (useful feature for PyData conference integration)
* [Aditya][] changed form for creating new events so that admins can
  assign themselves to a new event while creating it
* [Aditya][] added a `Sponsorship` model to AMY and integrated it with
  AMY (we can now track sponsors for events)
* [Aditya][] migrated `Host` to `Organization`: it fixed some naming
  inconsistencies
* in v1.6 we dropped support for numerical event IDs to rely only on slugs
  (e.g. `2016-08-13-Krakow` or `2017-01-xx-Boston`), now [Aditya][]
  cleaned some remains left in the code from before dropping the support
* [Piotr][] added support for `cancelled` tag used to mark events supposed to happen
  but not happening eventually
* [Chris][] added instructor training workflow, ie. huge part of AMY
  used for instructor training
* [Aditya][] added a feature for importing people, events, tasks from
  PyData conference site in a comfortable way

## Bug fixes

* [Chris][] tracked and fixed an error in part of AMY responsible for
  allowing users to log in with other credentials than user/password
  (currently: GitHub login)
* [Piotr][] fixed an API error occuring in some views (endpoints) when using CSV or
  YAML return format
* [Chris][] added access to AMY for people in invoicing group
* [Chris][] replaced entity `&mdash;` with actual char `â€”`
* [Aditya][] added a contact field on `Sponsorship` model
* [Chris][] fixed issue with user social integration with GitHub
  getting out of sync
* [Piotr][] fixed JavaScript code responsible for generating dates (it was generating
  e.g. `2016-8-3`, it's now generating `2016-08-03`)
