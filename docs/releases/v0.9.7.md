# AMY release v0.9.7

*This note was taken from v1.0.0; sorry for the brevity.*

-   [Piotr][] added a new country: 'Online' (for international / online events,
    like some Instructor Trainings).
-   The dashboard was changed to show not only upcoming, but also
    ongoing workshops (in the same column).
-   [Greg][] added some helper commands to report inconsistencies in PDF
    certificates for instructors.
-   [Greg][] also removed old command used for checking AMY's database against
    SWC site's archive. Site has moved to use AMY's API, so the archive
    was gone and the command was made redundant.
-   [Piotr][] updated `check.py` script (used for checking workshop settings
    correctness) from workshop-template repository.
-   [Greg][] cleared up titles of forms introduced in v0.9.5.
-   [Piotr][] split these forms' templates and added SWC and DC logos to them.
