# AMY release v1.3.2

*This note was taken from v1.4.0; sorry for the brevity.*

New feature: stop using dots (`.`) for usernames, use underscores (`_`)
instead.

This was an interesting issue: since we rely on some Ruby software on the SWC
website, we can't have dots in filenames (they're treated as parameter access
operator, for example: `banaszkiewicz.piotr` is `piotr` parameter on
`banaszkiewicz` object). But we have filenames that correspond to usernames in
AMY. So it was necessary to drop dots and switch to underscoresâ€¦
