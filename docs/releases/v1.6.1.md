# AMY release v1.6.1

We're taking momentum! Two days after [v1.6.0][] release, we're releasing a minor
bug-fix version [v1.6.1][] which is not as small as you might think.


## New features

* [Aditya][] changed the default value for `invoice status` field for
  events to "Not invoiced" (it was: "unknown").
* [Piotr][] added a link to the login form on the logout page.  In future, we're going
  to [redirect to the login page with a message](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/issues/867),
  but we're waiting for Django to release a feature that will allow us to do
  this easily.
* [Piotr][] restyled login page so that it's clearer that people can use user+password
  OR GitHub account to log into AMY.


## Bug fixes

* [Chris][] provided tests that make sure we don't have bugs associated
  with saving M2M-related objects in an `AutoProfileUpdateForm`.
* [Piotr][] added a link to the profile view page in the top navigation bar.  This
  links to a `trainee-dashboard` page if current user is not an admin, and to
  a `person-details` page otherwise.
* [Chris][] fixed indentation of lists when they're placed inside of
  tables.
* [Chris][] added clickable links in some help texts in the
  [training request form](https://amy.software-carpentry.org/workshops/request_training/).
* [Chris][] fixed wording in one field of the aforementioned form.
* [Piotr][] added a missing migration (we commonly forget to add migrations when
  there are small changes introduced).


## Other

* [Aditya][] changed some text fields in AMY's models so that they
  cannot be equal to a `NULL` (or `None`) value.  Instead an empty string is
  used for these fields' default values.  Some fields, especially ones with
  a uniqueness constraint, had to be left as nullable.  In particular, this
  makes the `Event.slug` a required field.
