# AMY release v1.5.4

Yesterday AMY [v1.5.4][] was released with a bunch of interesting changes.


## New features

* AMY is now capable of going through all active workshops and checking if
  their metadata (slug, start/end date, instructors and helpers) had changed.
  If so, a notification would be shown to the person associated with the event.
* [Aditya][] improved history log by enabling it to show related
  objects' real names instead of IDs.
* [Greg][] added a button to mail everyone involved in a workshop
* as part of his GSoC 2016 project, [Chris][] added the trainings
  dashboard in its first shape
* [Chris][] in collab with [Greg][] added SWC/DC instructor
  badge indicators to: all persons, event details, and "find instructors" views
* [Piotr][] upgraded the "Find instructors" view to enable admins to search
  for not only instructors, but also in-progress instructor trainees and people
  who once had been associated with the workshop organization. Therefore the
  new name for "Finding instructors" is now "Find Workshop Staff".


## Bug fixes

* [Aditya][] fixed permissions issue when accessing event details page
  by people without permission to add ToDo items.
* [Piotr][] fixed a small error preventing DataCarpentry logo from showing up on DC
  workshop request page.
* [Piotr][] fixed a small error doubling people with both superuser and `admin` group
  permissions in the admin lookup backend.
* Even smaller error was pointing admins to use wrong URL in import event
  template.  It is now fixed.
* [Chris][] fixed the former "debriefing" view (now
  "instructors by date") errors concerning emails generation when some people's
  emails were unavailable.
* [Chris][] fixed probably the oldest unnoticed issue ever: wrong link
  generated for airport's IATA code.
* [Chris][] fixed missing template from one of the new
  features for this release.
