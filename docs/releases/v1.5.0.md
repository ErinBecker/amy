# AMY release v1.5.0

Development of AMY in February had seen a boost due to the winter break, and
that ended with today's release of [v1.5.0][].


## New features

The biggest new features for this release:

* new workshops requests once accepted are linked to resulting events
* admins now can submit invoices from AMY
* admins can now receive event submissions (this should work really well for
  self-organized workshops that already have a workshop page)

Other changes:

* badge details view allows for filtering
* development and production software was updated
* production assets (JavaScript and CSS files) are now compressed and served
  with unique name
* persons merging was reworked and is now a lot better
* it's possible to find duplicates in the database now
* base templates were renamed to lower confusion
* API returns award date for every person for every badge
* added CSV renderer to some API endpoint for exporting members
* debrief was renamed and also allows for CSV export
* `Award` model gained `awarded_by` field pointing to the person responsible
  for awarding a badge
* person lookup in some places now works for "Name Lastname" pattern too.

Changes contributed by [Greg][]:

* CSV export of instructor completion rates
* CSV export of missing instructor certificates

(Greg's responsible for training new instructors.)


## Bug fixes

* Django Rest Framework erroring URLs were removed (still not sure what caused
  them to error-out)
* dashboard and workshop issues now show only active (== not stalled, not
  marked as complete) events
* workshop issues was extended by providing a list of workshops without any
  assigned instructors
* a rare error when looking someone up was fixed
* API throttle rates have been increased
* current and upcoming events on the dashboard are now based off of published
  events.
